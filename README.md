## Description

Using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, Scraper.py scrapes a product's name, price, and link for the first couple pages of a user input Amazon product search. It also ouputs the scraped data of each product to a .csv file, that is saved to the user's 'Documents' folder, with each product's info being stored in its own row.

## Requirements

To install all the needed python packages, run this command in the directory that you stored the file requirements.txt:  **pip install -r requirements.txt**

## Usage

Just run Scraper.py in any python interpreter and input the product you would like to search for when prompted. To access the created .csv file, just go to your 'Documents' folder and look for a .csv file that is named after the product you searched for.
